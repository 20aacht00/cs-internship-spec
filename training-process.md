# Training Process

Each course consists of some steps (about 10 steps). Interns should accomplish all steps to graduates the course.
The steps are ordered, so to unlock a step, the intern should accomplish its previous step.

Each step is a set of some **Study Items** and some **Tasks**.


## Study Items and Tasks

**Study Items** are some resources that should be studied. It could be a chapter of a book, an article, a blog post or a video.

If it is an online resource available on the web, its link is provided in the step. If it is a chapter of an eBook or a video which is not available online, the intern should find it herself. Finding the resource is a part of the process itself and improves the search skills for the intern.

**Tasks** are some pieces of work that intern should do. Examples of tasks are *'Writing a piece of code to do something'*, *'Achieving a specific badge on StackOverflow'*, *'Doing a research about a specific concept'* and ...

## Starting a Step

To start a step, the mentor gives the step content to the intern. The intern has 2 days to assess the step and give an estimate which he/she is committed to finish this step. This is very important as it is the main practice for integrity. Mentors are progressively checking the interns for their committment integrity.

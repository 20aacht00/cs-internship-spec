### Integrity
We practice integrity by being strict on these situations:

### Dare to Estimate
We practice estimation skills by creating on these situations:
 - Intern should estimate (and a promise on it) for each step.

### Dare to Ask
We practice asking skills by creating on these situations:
 - Running *Step 0*. In this step intern should contact everyone in the club to get familiar with them and make it easy to ask questions.
 - Some tasks within steps so intern should ask something in StackOverflow
 
 ### Dare to Answer
 We practice answering skills by creating on these situations:
  - While in the club, other poeple will contact the intern asking some questions.
  - Some tasks within steps so intern should answer something in StackOverflow.
 
 ### Presentation Skills
 As a mandatory phase of each step, interns should present their achievements through a Twitch presenation.
 
 ### Sharing on Social Networks
 To pass each step, interns must share their *"leanred lessons"*, *"achievements"* and *"feelings"* on Twitter and LinkedIn.

 - **Design**: Designing solutions

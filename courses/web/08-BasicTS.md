## Step 8. Basic TS

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

  What you should do in this part could simply abbreviated into four main sequentially tasks: **Watch**, **Think**, **Write** and **Talk**
  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. In this report you should:
	  - write your understandings of the proposed concepts in the video.
	  - write your answers to the questions asked in the video.
	  - write at least three paragraphs about your related experience and observations to the concepts in the video.

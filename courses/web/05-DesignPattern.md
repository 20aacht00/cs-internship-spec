## Step 5. Design Pattern

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

2. Pass this at exercism.org:

   - Resistor Color

   Learn how to run tests for these steps, and run all available tests in spec file (remove x from the start of each xtest).

   - Use GitHub as your source control.
   - Publish it on your jsFiddle account.

3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com with 5 stars up to **lesson 285**.
4. Achieve [**Commentator**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/31/commentator) badge on StackOverflow.
5. Find at least 5 other online resources about client-side JS & Tooling, and explain why you chose them.
6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
7. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on the Twitch platform. You should record your live twitch and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation about its content. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.
8. It's time to be a mentor. Ask your mentor to start your onboarding process for mentorship.

### Mentors Training

- In the mentoring training path, you should watch the the **"seventh"** and **"eighth"** videos of the 8 videos for the "Communication Training" course. Here are the links:

  (If you do not have access to these links please inform your Mentoring Intern.)

  What you should do in this part could simply abbreviated into four main sequentially tasks: **Watch**, **Think**, **Write** and **Talk**
  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. In this report you should:
	  - write your understandings of the proposed concepts in the video.
	  - write your answers to the questions asked in the video.
	  - write at least three paragraphs about your related experience and observations to the concepts in the video.
  4. Finally, send your report to your mentoring intern to set a meeting for the next sprint. In this meeting, try to **Talk** about your observations you had during the current sprint.

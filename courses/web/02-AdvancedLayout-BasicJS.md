## Step 2. Advanced Layout - Basic JS

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. In this report you should:
	  - write your understandings of the proposed concepts in the video.
	  - write your answers to the questions asked in the video.
	  - write at least three paragraphs about your related experience and observations to the concepts in the video.
  4. Finally, send your report to your mentoring intern to set a meeting for the next sprint. In this meeting, try to **Talk** about your observations you had during the current sprint.

## Step 3. IntermediateJS(I)

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
  `#cs_internship`
  `#[courseName]`
  `#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:

  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report

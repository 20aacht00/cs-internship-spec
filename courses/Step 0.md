# Ice-Breaking Step
You are totally new to the club, Welcome to the club! There are lots of people in this club willing to help you. But how? How can you get help from them? Who is who!? Who knows what!?
This is your first task, you should talk (literaly talk on the phone or Skype) and get to know each other.

## Tasks
Contact every person in your club. Introduce yourself and ask them to introduce themselves. Within each conversation you should achieve these goals:
 - Introduce yourself, so they can introduce you to the others later in the club.
 - You should ask (and convince) 5 of them to introduce you in the club (Writing and posting a paragraph about you)
 - Get to know everything about him/her
   1. Who is she/he? 
   2. What is her/his background? 
   3. What type of technical questions can you ask from she/he?
 - Create [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) account.
 - Create [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/) account.
 - Tweet your **feeling** about her/him.

## Step 3. Web In Practice I (Client)

### Guideline

- Ask your mentor for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report

## Instructor Notes <!-- omit in toc -->

1. Mentors should give a detailed description about the scope and content of the step to intern and make sure that everything is clear for him/her and help him/her to set a more reliable deadline.
2. First thing first, ask your intern to search about the **MVC** pattern and how to implement it using vanilla JS for task 6. You can give a brief explanation about the design patterns to him/her, but It's not the goal of this course to learn about the design patterns. After searching, you can give [this code](https://github.com/msynk/cs-internship/tree/master/web/step3) as a sample of mvc pattern to intern but make sure that he/she will not just copy the sample!

## Step 5. Numpy

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report
  
  
### Study Items


  1. [No bullshit guide to linear algebra](README.md): Chapter 7 (part 7-7 is excluded and is optional)
  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 2 (Introduction to Numpy)

### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Vox Populi**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/1108/vox-populi) badge on StackOverflow.

 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 357**.
 3. Solve problems 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, and 7.9 from chapetr **seven** in **[No bullshit guide to linear algebra](README.md)** **(Theorical problems)**.
 4. Solve problems 4.10, 4.11, 4.13, 7.2, 7.3, 7.4, 7.5, 7.6, 7.7, and 7.9 from **[No bullshit guide to linear algebra](README.md)** with **Numpy** **package** and then compare your results with previous steps **(Code based problems)**.
    - Use your GitHub as source control.
 5. Find at least 5 other online resources about numpy, and explain why you chose them.
 6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 7. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Linkedin live platform.

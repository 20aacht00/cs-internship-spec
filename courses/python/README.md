# Python

## Outlook
This course is designed for students who want to learn Python programming language in the **DataScience** approach. In this course, you will learn how to use Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries. Besides, learning the Linear Algebra is one of the main parts of this course. By doing so, you will be able to work and solve linalg (linear algebra) exercises with the most popular Python **DataScience** packages like Numpy, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

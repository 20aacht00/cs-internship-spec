# Guidelines for LinkedIn Live Presentation

You should give a 20-minute presentation on LinkedIn Live about the content of your step.

Record your live presentation and then send it, along with the title and description of your presentation, in the "CS Internship - Coordination -> General" group and tag your coordinator. This title and description will be used when your coordinator uploads your live presentation to YouTube.

When your presentation on LinkedIn ends, take a screenshot of the comments on your live presentation post. Send this screenshot in the "CS Internship - Coordination -> General" group and tag your coordinator so they can identify the attendees of your live presentation.

All LinkedIn Live presentations will be published on the [CS Internship YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@csinternship8859).

Good luck ðŸš€

## Step 6. Linear Algebra

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

 4. Solve problems exercise from chapter **Three** in **Mathematics for Machine Learning** **(Theorical problems)**.
 5. Solve problems exercise from chapter **Four** in **Mathematics for Machine Learning** **(Theorical problems)**. 
 6. Solve problems exercise from chapter **Five** in **Mathematics for Machine Learning** **(Theorical problems)**.
 7. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 8. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.

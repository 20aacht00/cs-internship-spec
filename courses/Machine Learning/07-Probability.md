## Step 7. Machine Learning Basics II

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

## Step 5. Numpy and Pandas and Matplotlib

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 2 (Introduction to Numpy)
  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 3 (Data Manipulation with Pandas)
  3. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 4 (Visualization with Matplotlib)

### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Student**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/2/student) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 223**.
 3. Do the excercise 5 in step 4 again but open the CSV file with **Pandas** **package** as a dataframe and add new four columns to it with name **MA1, MA2, MA3, and MA4** and for these columns calculate the [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of close price for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 (N=5, 10, 15, and 30).
 4. Find at least 5 other online resources about numpy, and explain why you chose them.
 5. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 6. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.

## Step 5. Numpy, Pandas and Matplotlib

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 2 (Introduction to Numpy).
  2. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 3 (Data Manipulation with Pandas).
  3. [Python Data Science Handbook](README.md): Chapter 4 (Visualization with Matplotlib).

### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Commentator**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/31/commentator) badge on StackOverflow.
 2. Achieve [**Nice Question**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/20/nice%20question) badge on StackOverflow.
 3. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 223**.
 4. Do the exercise 3 in step 4 again but open the CSV file with **Pandas** **package** as a dataframe and add new four columns to it with name **MA1, MA2, MA3, and MA4** and for these columns calculate the [Moving Average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average) of close price for durations of 5, 10, 15, and 30 (N=5, 10, 15, and 30).
 5. Find at least 5 other online resources about numpy & pandas & matplotlib, and explain why you chose them.
 6. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 7. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.


### Mentors Training

- In the mentoring training path, you should watch the **"seventh"** and **"eighth"** videos of the 8 videos for the **"Communication Training"** course.  Here's the links:

  (If you do not have access to the links please inform your Mentoring Intern.)

  What you should do in this part could simply abbreviated into four main sequentially tasks: **Watch**, **Think**, **Write** and **Talk**
  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make you sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts that you heard in the video in you daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. This report should contain your experience and observations during the week.
  4.  Finally, after a week, set a time with a Mentor and **Talk** about these concepts and your observations.

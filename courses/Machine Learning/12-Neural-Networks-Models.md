## Step 12. Neural Networks Models

### Guideline

- Ask your coordinator for a detailed description of the step content before setting a deadline.

- For each study item and each task, you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter, and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your coordinator a report including the following items:
  1. Links to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?

  You will have a session with a technical mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 15 (Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks).
  2. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 16 (Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks).
  3. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 17 (Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data).


### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Explainer**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4368/explainer) badge on StackOverflow.  
 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 429**.
 3. Extracting features from the image and generate a english sentence that describes the image that is called Caption [(data)](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset).
 4. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your coordinator to schedule a live presentation session for you on your deadline day.
 5. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Linkedin live platform. You should record your Linkedin live at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All Linkedin live presentations will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.

## Step 12. Neural Networks Models

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week, specifying the relevant task or study item for each link.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage you are satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.
  
  
### Study Items

  1. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 15 (Classifying Images with Deep Convolutional Neural Networks).
  2. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 16 (Modeling Sequential Data Using Recurrent Neural Networks).
  3. [Python Machine Learning](README.md): Chapter 17 (Generative Adversarial Networks for Synthesizing New Data).


### Tasks

 1. Achieve [**Explainer**](https://stackoverflow.com/help/badges/4368/explainer) badge on StackOverflow.  
 2. Pass all lessons on TypingClub.com **with 5 stars** up to **lesson 429**.
 3. Extracting features from the image and generate a english sentence that describes the image that is called Caption [(data)](https://www.kaggle.com/hsankesara/flickr-image-dataset).
 4. Exactly **7 days** before your deadline, ask your mentor to arrange a twitch time for you on your deadline day.
 5. You should give a 20-min presentation about the content of this step, on Twitch platform. You should record your twitch at the time of presentation and send it to your mentor with a brief explanation of the topic. All twitches will be published on the CS Internship YouTube channel.

## Step 2. Collections, Control Flows, and Linear Algebra

### Guideline

- For each study item and each task you should post an update to LinkedIn, Twitter and Telegram using the following hashtags:
`#cs_internship`
`#[courseName]`
`#[stepNumber]`

- At the end of each week, you are supposed to give your mentor a report including the following items:
  1. Link to all your posts during the last week specifying the relevant task or study item for each link, and also mention the exact date that each one of them were posted.
  2. How many hours did you spend on cs_internship last week?
  3. What percentage are you satisfied with what you did last week?
  
  You will have a session with your mentor based on your report.

  1. **Watch** the specified video. Watch it deeply! Make sure you have settled a proper environment and situation to watch it. In this way, you can have the highest of your focus on it.
  2. **Think** about the discussed concepts in this video in your daily attitudes. Your task is to observe and find the concepts you heard in the video in your daily life. 
  3. **Write** a report about what you understood from this video. In this report you should:
	  - write your understandings of the proposed concepts in the video.
	  - write your answers to the questions asked in the video.
	  - write at least three paragraphs about your related experience and observations to the concepts in the video.

  4. Finally, send your report to your mentoring intern to set a meeting for the next sprint. In this meeting, try to **Talk** about your observations you had during the current sprint.

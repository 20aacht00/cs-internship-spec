## Interview Process
This is meeting is designed to help under-training-mentor to get ready for leading an *Entrance Interview* meeting by leting her/him to debrief the meeting. This meeting should be hold right after the meeting.

1. Debriefing has two main parts: 
   1. Mentor should express her/his original feelings about the meeting, not talkinb about the facts, just feelings.
   2. Mentor should describe the meeting NOT in details and NOT using facts! Mentor should try to see the whole meeting as a big picture and try to extract its **main parts** and describe them. After a couple of meetings, mentor's debries should be something near to [Entrance Interview](/meetings/meeting-entrance-interview.md).
2. Attendees: Interviewer, Observer (Mentor)

## Interview Meeting Content

- Help them to express their feelings and make their Mirror Neurons stronger and stronger!
- Empower their *"expressing feelings capabilities"* over Skype!

### Flow
1. **What's your current feeling? -** Talk about your feelings, JUST feelings.
2. **How do you see the main parts of the meeting? -** Make them to think about the meeting from a higher perspective, NOT just repeating the words and facts.

### What happens next?
After a couple of meetings with a mentor (usually more than 3), when the mentor is in a good state, in temrs of the ability to decompose the meeting and describe each part, the process will have some changes. After this, mentor should study the *Entrance Interview* document before each meeting and track and match the meeting with the document. After each meeting the mentor can contribute and improve the documentation if it is needed. 
After a while when the mentor feels ready for being the interviewer, she/he will be assigned to interview someone easy! Easy means someone which we know before the meeting and the interview result is some kind of obvious before the meeting.

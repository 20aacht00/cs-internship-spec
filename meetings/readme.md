# Meetings

There are different kinds of meetings which mentors should master.

- [**Entrance Interview**](/meetings/meeting-entrance-interview.md): This is the frist and the most important interview with a new intern. If the intern says yes he/she should really mean it based on a really important decsion in her/his life!
- [**Entrance Debrief Interview**](/meetings/entrance-interview-debrief.md): In this meeting we ask the under-training-mentor to debrief the meeting.

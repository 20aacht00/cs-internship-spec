# Problem Check Meeting

At CS Internship we deeply believe in *Commitment* and *Integrity*.
In our team, there is no place for someone without *Commitment* and *Integrity*. If such situation happens we call it a **"Problem"**!

This meeting will be hold if we believe someone is threatenting our team's integrity. In another word, we hold this meeting if we feel a crisis in our team. 

Interns attending a problem check session fit into one of these two categories:
1. Those who are considered as having commitment and integrity issues.
2. Those who had been attending a course in the CS Internship before, but had to leave due to integrity failure, and now are willing to join again.

## Goals
This meeting has specific goals as described below. The intern:
 - Should understand the complete story of her/his problem.
 - Should discover the *root cause* of this problem.
 - Should be open, and completely accept her/his weakness.
 - Should make an important decision to work on the weakness, and specifiy measurements for that.
 
## Root Cause Analysis
Mostly the root cause of a problem is described with an unrelated (yet beautiful) excuse.
In the root cause analysis process we work to help the intern to find its real root cause. It happens using [*"5 Whys"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique.
By asking *whys* about her/his reasonings we help to reach the real root cause.
Mostly the real root cause is some kind of:
### Fear
### Neglectance
Although *neglectance* itself is a kind of *fear* it worth to dedicate a specific section to describe it.
Neglectance is the fear to face the reality that I don't want this! Not having enough courage to claim I don't want this. Instead she/he decides to neglect so she/he can avoid the difficulty of taking the decision.

# Instructor Notes
- This meeting is supposed to be a serious one, which leads to two serious decision:  
    - We (cs internship) should decide whether we want to continue working with the intern or not.
    - Intern should decide if they want to continue the course or not.

- Currently, the only member who is eligible to hold the problem check meeting (the one who talks with the intern) is Mehran.

- The first thing to do as a mentor when a problem occurs, is not to ask for a problem check meeting held by Mehran or anyone eligible. A mentor and their intern should talk with each other about the problem and can go through a **process similar to the problem check meeting** to solve the problem, before the mentor asks Mehran to hold this meeting.

- The same problem should not occur for the third time. If this happens, you've implicitely stated to the intern that it's fine to violate the rules and integrity. 

# FAQ

**1- When should a mentor ask a qualifed member (Mehran, currently) for a problem check meeting?**  
Whenever the following conditions are true, you should ask for a problem check meeting:      

- You are sure that you yourself are not the cause of the problem. 
- You as the mentor, conclude that the root cause is something completely about the intern such as their mindset or their situation. 
- The intern does not accept that the problem exists.

**2- Should I do anything before asking for a problem check meeting when there exists a problem?**  

You as the mentor, should do your best to solve the problem, via talking with your intern. You can simulate the problem check meeting, use the __5 Whys__ technique etc. in order to solve the problem.   
If you decide to continue to work with the intern, you're responsible for the time spent by `cs-internship` for the intern. You should do your best to figure out if the best action is to continue working with the intern or not.  
If you fail to solve the problem or make the decision to continue or not, you should consult Mehran about the situation, inform him about the things told by you and intern, seek for information and advice on how you could've done better and try again to solve the problem.  
Repeat the process untill the point where You and Mehran agree on that there should be held a problem check meeting.  

- Once again, if a problem occurs and you consider it solved after talking with your intern and decide to continue the course, be aware that you are risking the time and effort of `cs-internship` and its members. You're responsible for the decision. Do your best to make the best decision.

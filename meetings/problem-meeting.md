# Problem Meeting

At CS Internship we deeply believe in *Commitment* and *Integrity*.
In our team, there is no place for someone without *Commitment* and *Integrity*. If such situation happens we call it a **"Problem"**!

This meeting will be hold if we believe someone is threatenting our team's integrity. In another word, we hold this meeting if we feel a crisis in our team. 

## Goals
This meeting has specific goals as described below. The intern:
 - Should understand the complete story of her/his problem.
 - Should discover the *root cause* of this problem.
 - Should be open, and completely accept her/his weakness.
 - Should make an important decision to work on the weakness, and specifiy measurements for that.
 
## Root Cause Analysis
Mostly the root cause of a problem is described with an unrelated (yet beautiful) excuse.
In the root cause analysis process we work to help the intern to find its real root cause. It happens using [*"5 Whys"*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Whys) technique.
By asking *whys* about her/his reasonings we help to reach the real root cause.
Mostly the real root cause is some kind of:
### Fear
### Neglectance
Although *neglectance* itself is a kind of *fear* it worth to dedicate a specific section to describe it.
Neglectance is the fear to face the reality that I don't want this! Not having enough courage to claim I don't want this. Instead she/he decides to neglect so she/he can avoid the difficulty of taking the decision.

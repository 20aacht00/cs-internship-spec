# Problem Meeting

At CS Internship we deeply believe in *Commitment* and *Integrity*.
In our team, there is no place for someone without *Commitment* and *Integrity*. If such situation happens we call it a **"Problem"**!

This meeting will be hold if we believe someone is threatenting our team's integrity. In another word, we hold this meeting if we feel a crisis in our team.

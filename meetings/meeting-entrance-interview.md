## Interview Process
This is the frist and the most important interview with a new intern. If the intern says yes he/she should really mean it based on a really important decsion in her/his life!

1. Initiates by a mentor: 
   1. Mentor arranges a Skype meeting.
   2. While arranging a meeting, mentor has the chance to break the ice with the intern and get friends.
2. Attendees: Interviewer, Observer (Mentor), Intern 1, Intern 2 (optional)

## Interview Meeting Content
### Goals
- Let them feel comfortable.
- Clarifying the 'Integrity' concept.
- Making 'Yes' a very difficult word to say!

### Flow

1. **What have you heard -** What have you heard about cs_internship? what made you want to participate?
   1. *Note*: each intern wanting to be added to queue, is supposed to talk to 5 people who are in the course (either as mentor or intern) and learn from them about the course. They have to find that 5 people by exploring the social media, and looking for #cs_internship hashtags.
2. **My Story -** Me, telling *my* story (Me towards us approach). In this way they will feel more comfortable to share their story.
   1. Telling them the story of me, and us. 
   2. What is the history? 
   3. Why are we doing this?
3. **Your Story -** Let them talk about themselves. Let them feel free to talk about their work, their achievements, their passions and ...
   1. What have they heard about us?
   2. Encourage them to talk about why are they making this decision.
4. **Integrity**
   - The most important rule of us.
   - Never ever break it!
   - 2 sides of the rule.
   - Applies to all aspects of our work: from a simple Skype meeting to accomplishing task within a sprint.
5. **The Mentorship Process** It should be clarified for them that they are required to contribute to this internship at some point due to two reasons (note that the reasons should be stated in this interview as well): 
   1. A large portion of learning process (both for technology and soft skills) are acquired through mentorship which in turn includes helping the interns and also fulfilling some tasks assigned to them in the sprint sessions.
   2. The interns should be told that this internship is free of charge, but we only request them to do one thing in return; to be part of this internship and help the new comers to learn. 
6. **The Learning Process -** How do we work
   - Steps
   - Agree to be active on Twitter and LinkedIn
7. **The Promise -** Clarifying the required commitment:
   - The promise of ***9 months***: This plan will be the highest priority within this period.
   - The promise of ***Weekly hours***: Integrity starts here.
8. **Think about it -** We ask them to NOT to answer the *promise question* now! They are now in a high energy level which could be temporary. Let them have their 2 days to think about the promises seriously.
9. **Happy Ending -** What animal are you!

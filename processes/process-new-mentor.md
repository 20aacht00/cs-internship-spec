# New Mentor Process

We are open and enthuciastic to work with new mentors. We believe they can bring a lot of value to our program.
But hey! Mentoring is not an easy job at all. Mentors are going to be the evangelist of our culture. They are going the incept what they are to the interns, so they should be a true CSer to accompolish this critical job.

## Mentor Specifications
We love to work with mentors having these specifications. Most of these items are based on [CS Culture](http://isazadeh.net/ayaz/announcements/CsCulture.pdf) by [Ayaz](http://isazadeh.net/ayaz/index.htm)

#### Integrity
we must have integrity, must live the integrity through our life. The integrity must be a core value in our beliefs. We konw the integrity is not a state, it is a path. We are a bunch of people living our integrity journey in our life life.

#### Courage
We have courage, the courage to ask, the courage to answer, the courage to be criticized and ...

#### Work
we love our work, the process of helping the others. If it is not a joyful work for us, there should be nothing making us to do so. So basically mentors should be volunteers to do the mentoring and volunteerly share their time to help the others.

#### Dynamism
We are dynamic in all aspects of our work. We continuously look at our work and process to improve it.


## The Flow
New mentors should pass some basic requirements to enter the program as a mentor.
For each new member, there should be a previous successful *integrity situation* happened between the mentor and one of us. So we can make sure the level of integrity of the mentor.
If so, the mentor should send a **Commitment Statement** to the mentors group, stating why is she/he joining the mentors and what is his commitment in the group. The commitment should contain the time that she/he is going to dedicate for this job weekly.

The **first step** for mentors is to learn what is being a mentor, and it is her/his job to learn, by asking the other mentors, studying the documents.

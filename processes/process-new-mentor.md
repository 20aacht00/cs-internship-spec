We are open and enthuciastic to work with new mentors. We believe they can bring a lot of value to our program.
But hey! Mentoring is not an easy job at all. Mentors are going to be the evangelist of our culture. They are going the incept what they are to the interns, so they should be a true CSer to accompolish this critical job.

## Mentor Specifications
We love to work with mentors having these specifications.

#### Integrity
A mentor must have integrity, must live the integrity through her/his life. The integrity must be a core value in her/his beliefs. We konw the integrity is not a state, it is a path. We should see the mentor during the integrity journey ini her/his life.

#### Courage
The mentors have courage, the courage to ask, the courage to answer, the courage to be criticized and ...

#### Work
The mentors must love their work, the process of helping the others. If it is not a joyful work there should be nothing making her/him to do so. So basically mentors should be volunteers to do the mentoring and volunteerly share their time to help the others.

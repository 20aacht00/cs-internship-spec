This document aims to describe what the person in charge of queue during the sprint (which we call **queue executive**) is supposed to do.

## Being ready to be asked by a mentor to do a task
As the person in charge of queue, you should be ready to be asked by another mentor to do a task, such as adding a person to telegram group. Or remove someone, after they are interviewed.  

**Mentor and queue executive communications must comply with the following rules:**  
1- mentor should ask queue executive, by what time, the task is supposed to be done.  
2- queue executive, should tell mentor the time the task will be done by.
3- Mentor is supposed to make sure the task gets done, by the time queue executive has promised.
3- Any mentor who asks the queue executive to do a task, is supposed to **double check** that the task is done well.  

## Check if we are ready to conduct an interview
Queue executive must know exactly how many interns each mentor is willing to have, and how many interns the mentor already has.  
Whenever queue executive finds out that there is a mentor who has less interns than they are willing to have, and there exists some applicants who want to enter one of our courses, queue executive must:  
1- Announce that we are ready to conduct an interview.  
2- Find a mentor to be assigned the task of organizing the interview.  
(Note that by organizing an interview we mean, to make sure that the interviewer is selected and notified, participating mentors are notified about interview time and they are informed about what they should do during the interview, make sure that interns already have talked with 5 others about the course and they are somehow familiar with the course, etc.)

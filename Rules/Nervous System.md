These decisions can be new decisions that have not been made before or a change in the existing decision. All decisions made must be made in accordance with the following structure and rules.

## Structure and Rules
* ### Storage in GitHub
    GitHub is currently the best storage  because it has some amazing tools to do it. If you edit decisions, you can view the history of changes in that decision. if something is unclear you can use from issue tool.

    Storage a decision alone is not enough to make it happen. Communication must be established to make decisions. 
    All decisions must be explained by one or more person to another.

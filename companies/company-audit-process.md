# Auditing Process
We will ask the company to hire us! During a fake recruitement process so we can audit the way they do the interview, onboarding and training processes.

### Hire me!
 - Interview
 - Onboarding
 - Training

We will check the team for integrity. We will have some interviews with developers, product owners, project managers, testers, UX team to understant how they can rely on each other.

## Board Integrity
 - What have you done during last 2 months?
 - What are you doing this week?
 - What will you do during the next 2 weeks?

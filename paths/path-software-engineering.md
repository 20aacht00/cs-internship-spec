# Software Engineering Path
This path is designed to improve software engineering skills for interns. We believe that each inter should practice software engineering skills. Also, in each level the intern gets familiar with some design patterns.

## Touch Typing Levels

#### Level 1: Understanding the mess
In this level, the intern can see and feel the mess in the code and the need for modularizing the code.
Each language and technologies has its own concepts for modularizing the code to a good granularity level.
The intern should be able to play with modularity and packaging concepts.

**Goal:** Understand and practice with modularization concepts of the language or technology.

#### Level 2: Usability

#### Level 3: Maintainability

#### Level 4: Testability

#### Level 5: Performance
